abstract="Several works have presented distinct ways to compute feature descriptor from different applications and domains. A main issue in Computer Vision systems is how to choose the best descriptor for specific domains. Usually, Computer Vision experts try several combination of descriptor until reach a good result of classification, clustering or retrieving -- for instance, the best descriptor is that capable of discriminating the dataset images and reach high correct classification rates. In this paper, we used feature descriptors commonly applied in handwritten images to improve the image classification from fruit datasets. We present distinct combinations of Zoning and Character-Edge Distance methods to generate feature descriptor from fruits. The combination of these two descriptor with Discrete Fourier Transform led us to a new approach for acquire features from fruit images. In the experiments, the new approaches are compared with the main descriptors presented in the literature and our best approach of feature descriptors reaches a correct classification rate of 97.5{\%}. Additionally, we also show how to perform a detailed inspection in feature spaces through an image visualization technique based on a similarity trees known as Neigbor Joining (NJ).",

    abstract = { Multidimensional projection techniques provide graphical representations computed based on instance similarities to enable the analysis of abstract and possibly large data sets. However, when the data set size grows these graphical representations can hardly avoid overlap among markers. To overcome this issue, while some techniques attempt to remove overlap after multidimensional projection, some projection techniques were developed considering non-overlapping constraints. In this work, we present an analysis of four overlap removal techniques and two projection techniques considering non-overlapping. The evaluation was performed according to five metrics that consider structural and similarity relations, and based on the results we provide a guide to use a technique according to the data set and analysis goals. }
